### Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create an environment that enables full CRUD functionality to registered users so that they can CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE books directly on the site without intermediaries.

The second goal is to provide a blog in which registered users can read, like and comment.

### Strategy

 This project uses Agile Methodology. A Kanban board in GitHub was created to support development process. A planning session generated 17 User Stories within 5 Epics, each one with their acceptance criterias. The development process was based on iterative incremental philosophy, adopting 1 week sprints with the following goals:
- <strong>Week 1</strong>: Basic structure and blog features running with boilerplate design and content.
- <strong>Week 2</strong>: CRUD functionalities of Books section running with boilerplate design and content.
- <strong>Week 3</strong>: Final version of the design and content + Messages.
- <strong>Week 4</strong>: Bugfix, final deploy and documentation.
